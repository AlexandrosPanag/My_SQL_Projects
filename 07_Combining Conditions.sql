/*
The NOT operator is applied to the column NetWorthInMillions which has all non-zero values for all the rows in the table. Applying NOT on a non-zero column value makes it a zero, and since zero isn't equal to 200, no rows are displayed.

Also note that if the table had a row with a zero value for the column NetWorthInMillions, it will still not display anything because NOT of zero is non-zero, which isn't equal to 200.
